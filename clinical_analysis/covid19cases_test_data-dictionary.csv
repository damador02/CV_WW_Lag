Note: Some entries show """"None"""" in the date field.  These are records which do not have dates associated with them; however they have been included as they are necessary to arrive at the correct totals. The automated compilation of cumulative totals treats """"None"""" as the earliest date, which is why the actual earliest data in the table may have large numbers in the cumulative total columns. Users who want to graph cumulative trends should consider subtracting values for """"None"""" dates to avoid displaying this artifact in their trend lines.

COVID-associated deaths are also counted in the “Cases” field. 

Note: If the cause of death was determined to be unrelated to COVID-19 (e.g. homicide) for an individual with confirmed COVID-19 infection, that case is not counted in the Death count (but counted in the Cases count).
